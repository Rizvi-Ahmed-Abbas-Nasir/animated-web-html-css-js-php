					<h6>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h6>
					<p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults

					</p>
					<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on

						limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in
						this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
