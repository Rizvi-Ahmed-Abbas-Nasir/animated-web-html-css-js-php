						including copyrights.  If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of our Site,
						unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work, and wish to have the allegedly infringing
						material removed, the following information in the form of a written notification (pursuant to
						17 U.S.C. § 512(c)) must be provided to our designated Copyright Agent:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
						<li>identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;</li>
						<li>identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and that you
							request us to remove;</li>
						<li>sufficient information to permit us to locate such material;</li>
						<li>your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</li>
						<li>a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the objectionable material is not
							authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or under the law; and</li>
						<li>a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of
							perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or
							that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact in a
						written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages,
						costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and
						allegation of copyright infringement.</p>

					<h3>General</h3>

					<p>These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may
						notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by
						prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site.  You are responsible for providing us
						with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address that you have
						provided us is not valid our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless
						constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.  Any changes to these Terms
						will be effective upon the earliest of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an
						e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes
						on our Site.  These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site.  Continued
						use of our Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such
						changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
						Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your
						contract with Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING
						ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>

					<p><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes in connection
						with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be
						resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an
						individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all
						arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and
						the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
						successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of
						services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>

					<p><strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> Before either party may seek
						arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing
						the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company
						should be sent to: Mumbai, Maharashtra. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may
						attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the
						claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
						arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be
						disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to
						which either party is entitled.</p>

					<p><strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action
						must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline
						imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>

					<p><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide
						the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with
						any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the
						authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have
						the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
						available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator
						shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and
						conclusions on which the award is based.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief
						on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator
						is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>

					<p><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND
						STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing
						that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. 
						Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules
						applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any
						litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to
						vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A
						JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>

					<p><strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes within the
						scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and
						not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or
						litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.</p>

					<p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly
						confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. 
						This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information
						necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or
						equitable relief.</p>

					<p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under
						the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific
						part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the
						Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

					<p><strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this
						Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such
						waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

					<p><strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination
						of your relationship with Company.</p>

					<p><strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may
						bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>

					<p><strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek
						emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo
						pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other
						rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

					<p><strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of
						defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation
						of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this
						Arbitration Agreement.</p>

					<p><strong>Electronic Communications.</strong> The communications between you and Company use
						electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices
						on the Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to
						receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and
						conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to
						you electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such communications would satisfy if it
						were be in a hard copy writing.</p>

					<p><strong>Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us
						regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
						these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in
						these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word
						"including" means "including without limitation". If any provision of these Terms is held to be
						invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid
						or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the
						maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship to Company is that of an independent
						contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  These Terms, and your rights
						and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred
						by you without Company’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract,
						delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  Company may freely
						assign these Terms.  The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon
						assignees.</p>

					<p><strong>Your Privacy.</strong> Please read our Privacy Policy.</p>

					<p><strong>Copyright/Trademark Information.</strong> Copyright ©. All rights reserved.  All
						trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on the Site are our property or the property of
						other third-parties. You are not permitted to use these Marks without our prior written consent
						or the consent of such third party which may own the Marks.</p>
